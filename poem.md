# 'Tis Moonlight, Summer Moonlight

'Tis *moonlight*, _**summer** moonlight_,  
All soft and still and fair;  
The solemn hour of midnight  
Breathes sweet thoughts everywhere,  

But most where trees are sending  
Their breezy boughs on high,  
Or stooping low are lending  
A shelter from the sky.  

And there in those wild bowers  
A lovely form is laid;  
Green grass and dew-steeped flowers  
Wave gently round her head.
